               <p>Krobus is a shadow person and, although he isn't hostile, still refers to other monsters as "his friends". He lives in the sewers and normally isn't seen outside interacting with other villagers. He dislikes dwarves, stating that a 1,000 year war between the dwarves and his people recently ended. He believes if the dwarves knew where he was, they'd send an assassin.

                The Wizard is aware of his presence and intervenes to prevent conflicts.</p>

              <p>The Mutant Bug Lair is an underground location that becomes accessible as part of the Dark Talisman Quest. The entrance to the lair is in the northwest corner of The Sewers.

                The player should be prepared to encounter monsters before entering the Mutant Bug Lair because there are a number of Mutant Grubs and Mutant Flies inside.
                
                Even though plants are growing here and fishing is possible, the game considers this location to be underground. Therefore, forageable items and artifact spots never spawn here.</p>

               <p>The Wizard asked me to retrieve the magic ink from his ex-wife's house... but to gain access I'll need a dark talisman. Enter the sewer and ask Krobus about the dark talisman.</p>

               <p>Pierre's General Store sells various seeds, saplings, fertilizer, ingredients and other useful items. As well as selling those items, Pierre also buys foraged items, crops, artisan goods, cooked dishes, and animal products from the player, which avoids waiting overnight for shipping. Some products in stock, namely seeds, will vary from season to season and others are in-stock year-round. Pierre's main competitor in the valley is JojaMart.

                Pierre's General Store is normally open most days at 9am, three hours after the player wakes up, and closes at 5pm. The player can enter the building until 9pm, but Pierre leaves the sales counter at 5pm every day, so the shop cannot actually be used to purchase or sell goods after 5pm. This is because the building also serves as Pierre's family home.</p>
